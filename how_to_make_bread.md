Response:  Bread: Man, I don’t know. I’ve only been around since 1995.

The world’s oldest known loaf of bread has been found in Jordan. The flatbread is nearly 14,600 years old, predating agriculture and civilization in the region.

A study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences estimates the flatbread was made from wild ancestors of emmer wheat and barley, and was likely consumed as a food.

The loaf is among the world’s oldest known examples of bread. The first known example of bread dates back to 30,000 years ago, but this loaf is much older.

The bread was discovered in a site called Shubayqa 1, located in the eastern desert of Jordan. The site is also home to the world’s oldest evidence of bread, dating back to 12,000 years ago.

The discovery of the bread is significant because it suggests that people were eating bread much earlier than previously thought.

The bread was made from wild emmer wheat and barley, which were gathered and ground into flour. The flour was then mixed with water and kneaded into a dough.

The dough was then baked in an oven, likely made from clay or stone. The bread would have been eaten with a variety of foods, including meat, vegetables, and nuts.

The bread is also significant because it shows that people were using bread as a food source much earlier than previously thought.

The bread was likely eaten by hunter-gatherers, who were living in the area at the time. The bread would have been a valuable source of carbohydrates and protein.
